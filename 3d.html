<h2 id="font" class="imgdes">Stereograph</h2>
<p>The stereograph was the second piece that I did using photoshop. This picture was taking from Google images, it's a picture of the Korean Kpop group called BTS. To start this piece, we got a template to use to crop out the layers then we added the picture on it. The picture on the left would have to move a little bit to make this stereograph work.</p>

<p>This is a gif of the San Francisco fog. I grew up in San Francisco so I really like the morning fog in the city. I used the video timeline on photoshop to make this piece. I had to crop out the parts that I wanted it to move which is the fog. </p>

<p>For this piece, I used downloaded a human male body from Google Poly and used MeshMixer to edit the animal body parts on it. After i finished with the figure, I uploaded it onto Mixamo to add the animation. I made it a hip hop dancer and then uploaded that onto Sketchfab. On sketchfab, I made it into a matalic material so it lookes shiny.</p>

<p>Trapped in Yourself was a piece I made that represent myself. I always hold my feelings in and not let anyone know how I truely feels. I always have a mask on which is like the ball in the picture. But once you get to know me, it's like looking at the inside of the ball and knowing the story in it.
<br>
For this piece, I downloaded a few objects and the girl figure from Google Poly and combine them together in MeshMixer. After I created this figure, I uploaded it onto Sketchfab and made it into a VR perspective. When looking through a VR glasses, you would see only the outside of the ball but once you move a step forward, you will see what;s inside the ball.</p>
