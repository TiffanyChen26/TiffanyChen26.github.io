<p>This piece of art was made when the time the COVID-19 pandemic started. During this time the whole country was locked down, everybody was quarantined. This image shows a bird trapped in a cage, representing the people at the time were being trapped at home. The glitch of the image represent confusion and fear of the people. I thought of using glitch to portray this kind of feeling because when people see glitch, often this happens when something is wrong or is broken with their electronic devices. They will be confused on what's going to happen next and how they are going to fix this problem. Often time, they would feel the fear of what if it can't be fix.</p>

<p>This is a water color painting of a self-portrait. The meaning behind this piece is to show that everybody puts up a facad of how great they are but in reality, we all have out ugly thoughts. This happens a lot when it comes to racism. We all say we are not racist but the truth is, we all are. We just don't show it. No matter where we learn it from, eihter from our parents or from the environment we grew up in, we will be biased agaist certain race.</p>

<p>Trapped in Yourself was a piece I made that represent myself. I always hold my feelings in and not let anyone know how I truely feels. I always have a mask on which is like the ball in the picture. But once you get to know me, it's like looking at the inside of the ball and knowing the story in it.
<br>
For this piece, I downloaded a few objects and the girl figure from Google Poly and combine them together in MeshMixer. After I created this figure, I uploaded it onto Sketchfab and made it into a VR perspective. When looking through a VR glasses, you would see only the outside of the ball but once you move a step forward, you will see what;s inside the ball.</p>

<p>For this piece, I used downloaded a human male body from Google Poly and used MeshMixer to edit the animal body parts on it. After i finished with the figure, I uploaded it onto Mixamo to add the animation. I made it a hip hop dancer and then uploaded that onto Sketchfab. On sketchfab, I made it into a matalic material so it lookes shiny.</p>

<p>This is a gif image of the city glitching. I downloaded an image from google and opened the image in text form in TextEdit. By changing the code I was able to create this glitch affect. I made four different glitch images and layered them together in photoshop by creating a frame animation. </p>

<p>This is a gif of the San Francisco fog. I grew up in San Francisco so I really like the morning fog in the city. I used the video timeline on photoshop to make this piece. I had to crop out the parts that I wanted it to move which is the fog. </p>

<h2 id="font" class="imgdes">Anaglyph</h2>
<p class="info">Anaglyph was the first piece where I first starting to use photoshop. I was tought how to make a picture three-dimentional by making the blue and red colors on it. When wearing the old fasion 3D glasses, it would great.</p>

<h2 id="font" class="imgdes">Stereograph</h2>
<p>The stereograph was the second piece that I did using photoshop. This picture was taking from Google images, it's a picture of the Korean Kpop group called BTS. To start this piece, we got a template to use to crop out the layers then we added the picture on it. The picture on the left would have to move a little bit to make this stereograph work.</p>
