      <p>Our primary focus is to have the GSR help us make decisions for this demo show. I decided to use the GSR to help me make decisions on what makeup look I should go for. In the beginning, as I have my finger on the GSR, I have the graph opened as well. When choosing the eye shadow color, I tested the color on my arm and see if the graph would increase. If the graph passes the red line, then I would choose that color. I would keep doing it until I get a color that had the graph reaches the highest. Then I would do the same with the eyelashes and lip color. For these two, I changed the decision-making a little bit. Instead of seeing which one would make the graph higher, I would see which one would have the graph stay constant the longest. The ones that drop down would be a no. In the end, I was able to create a makeup look that was all based on the decision of my micro box. </p>

        For this show, I was in charge of helping with the installment and de-installing after the show was over. I was also in charge of bringing food for the audience. I know there would be banana-flavored food so I thought about bringing Nutella. Because Nutella comes in a big jar, I thought it would be more sanitizing and convenient if I put Nutella in small containers so I got a bunch of plastic sauce containers with lids and I scoop Nutella in them. I also bought some sugar cookies just cause why not haha.
