  <p>For this project, I added the GSR to my micro box. The GSR is made with a wire with copper tape at one end and the other end would be inserted into the breadboard that would be powered by analog 2 on the Arduino Xiao. The purpose of the GSR is that it can measure your sweat glands and it would tell you how nervous or excited you are. The three videos above are test videos, one of the LED lights working with the dimmer program with Processing, and the other two videos are of the GSR working with the serial graph and the neopixel LEDs.  </p>

      In this video I am using the GSR as I am playing Call of Duty. I stuck the GSR on the back of my phone where my two fingers usually placed. As you can see, when the game started, the graph started around 240 and as the game gets more intense, the graph started increasing and reach about 260 and above. I was getting more stress because I died twice in the game.

      In this video I am watching funny videos from TikTok. I placed the GSR on the table and placed my two fingers on it while watching the video on my phone. The graph started around 260-270 and towards the end, there was a funny clip of two girls falling from the escalator, I was lauphing so much that the graph went up to around 290 and above.

    My first activity was drawing. I drew with my Ipad and the graph was increasing as I was drawing. I think it is because I really love to draw and it just makes me excited to see my piece is coming together.

        My second activity was shopping. I chose to do shopping because I realized that everytime I add something to the shopping cart, I always hesitate at the very last step which is buying it. I wanted to test out if my stree level would increase by using the GSR. As I expected, the graph stayed pretty constant but it was very high. I was stressing throughout the entire time.

        The last activity was watching Tiktok. I was watching a live stream of someone playing a zombie killing game. I was pretty scared in the beginning because I wasnt expecting of what is happening and there was a few jump scares so the graph was pretty high. But it slowly decreases because it was getting pretty boring and I was already expecting the jumpscares.
