        This game is called Go Fish! Go Fish is a standard playing card game, each player will have 6 cards to begin with. The players are to complete a series of 4 cards with the same number. Players are to ask other players for a card that is matching with the card they have already in hand. If the player being asked doesn’t have the card they will say “go fish” and the player that was asking will get a card from the deck. This will continue until one player doesnt have any cards left. The player with the most series of cards wins the game.
