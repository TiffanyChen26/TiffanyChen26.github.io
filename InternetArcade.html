      <p> The game I played was Pacman Club, it was confusing in the beginning because I didn’t know how to add credit to play the game. From the beginning page, it said game over so I was very confused until I read the comments to see how to start the game. I know by adding the credits, you click on either the number 5 or 6, and then to start the game I have to click on the number 1. Then I just use the arrows to control the Pacman to go up, down, left, and right. The rules are the exact same and the goal of the game is also the same, you just need to eat all the white dots and the game ends. If you get eaten by the ghost three times, it is game over. It was pretty much what I expected when playing this game on the computer. The only difference between playing on an arcade cabinet is it’s controlled by a joystick instead of using buttons. Also, it is harder to play on the computer than in an arcade cabinet because the buttons are smaller and sometimes I would miss clicking on a button.
