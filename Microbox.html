      <p class="info">This is called a Micro-Box, it is built with a speaker, 2 led lights, 2 switches, a toggle switch for speed, and a toggle switch for volume. Everything is connected with wires that would be linked to a breadboard to create a circuit and itâ€™s powered by the XIAO that would be connected to your computer. After building the circuit, we used a software called Arduino to code out the function of the MicroBox. </p>
      <br>
      <p class="info">Something that was successful was that every button/toggle works and it does what it suppose to do. The toggle on the top left is the speed, it changed the speed of the song it is playing, the middle switch is the on/off button, and the top right button is the button that changes the song. The bottom center is the volume toggle. One thing that was not so successful was the coding. I wanted to change the song instead of using the class sample code but it was difficult to figure out how to do it. </p>
      <br>
      <p class="info">As for the GSR, shown in the video on the right, I built it with a braided wire with copper tape on the ends of it while the other end of the wire is inserted into the breadboard connected to the XIAO. This will read your sweat glands and will show how nervous or excited you are on the graph. In the video, I was watching my favorite part of Attack on Titan and it started off pretty boring so the graph was going down, but when the exciting part is coming up, the suspense of the video made me excited, the graph started to go up. But when it got to the main part of the show, after the suspense, I realized the graph went down again. It would only go up when it is getting excited, the excitement would bring it down.</p>
