        This game is based on a Chinese card game called 选乌龟 which translates to “pick the turtle”. The turtle is a reference to the card that is facing down on the side. The goal of this game is to get rid of all your cards and whoever has the matching card with the “turtle” card is the loser. But in my game, it is the opposite. The goal is to have the card that is matching with the “turtle” card. I also added a few steps into the game, the player’s way of choosing the next player's card is by spinning the number wheel. When the player got a match from the card they got back they could also go for another turn. The player could choose to not go and swap a card with the “turtle” card instead.
<br><br>
        When playing this game, I found it easier and more fun when there are more players playing. Of course, it can still be played when there are only 2 players. When I was playing it again a couple of times, I don’t really find a problem with my game, it went smoothly, but one thing I notice is, that people left out the rule of being able to swap cards with the “turtle” card. Nobody finds the need to swap the card to make it more complicated. In the end, the game works the same with or without that rule being in.

        Rules:
        <br><br>
        1. 2-4 player game <br><br>
        2. Deal everyone 13 cards except for player 1, leave the last card facedown on the board <br><br>
        3. Remove all pairs of matching face values (Ex: 2, 3, 4, King, Jack) <br><br>
        4. Starting from player 1, choose a card from the next player and if you have any new matching cards, place them down. Else. keep the card in your hand <br><br>
        - To choose a card, spin the spinner and take the card in that position from the player’s hand starting from the left side. If the remaining cards are less than the value of the spinner, loop back to the left side and continue counting. <br><br>
        - If you were able to form a matching pair from another player’s card, you get another turn, but can’t choose to target the same player (so max of 2 extra turns) <br><br>
        - Instead of taking another player’s card you  can also swap one of the cards in your hand with the facedown card. (even if it is a match, you still have to swap it) <br><br>
        5. The winner is the one that has the last remaining card that matches with the face down card. <br><br>
        6. If you run out of cards, you are out for that round <br><br>
        The player gets points equal to the face value of the final card.
        7. If the facedown card was the card that you put down, get double the points. <br><br>
        8. The winner is first to 25 points. <br><br>
