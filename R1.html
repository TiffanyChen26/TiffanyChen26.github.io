<h1>Reading 1</h1>

  Chapter 1
<br>
In chapter one, it talks about the root of cyborgs. Cyborg stood for Cybernetic Organisms and it’s a term created by a scientist named Manfred Clynes who designed and developed the CAT computer. The purpose of this is to create an “artifact-organism system” that can automatically do things the human body can do but in an alien environment, also known as the self-regulating system.
<br><br>
The first cyborg they built was a laboratory rat which they implanted the Rose osmotic pump that automatically injects chemicals into it. This is to make the rat being able to survive and adapt to alien environments such as being in space. Other cyborgs include the cochlear implant which is something that’s been around for deaf people to hear, there's an implant that is a chip inserted into the arm to open doors or turn on and off the light when you walk by. The one Warwick experimented on was an implant that connects the brain and a computer to send signals back and forth.
<br><br>
1. The Clynes and Klines definition of the cyborg is to have humans being able to adapt to new and alien demands in which humans would have implants in them that can automatically open the door or turn on and off the lights when you walk past. Or another implant that can send signals from the body to the computer or the other way around, from the computer to the brain. The one that Clark is proposing is doing all that without implants or surgery. An example of that is how the plane is only able to turn at a certain angle no matter how much the pilot turns the control stick.
<br><br>
2. An example of a self-regulating system is a standard toilet, they flush and refill automatically with the same amount of water. Another example of a self-regulating system is the human body. The organs work on their own to do whatever they need to do to keep the whole body functioning and alive.
<br><br>
3. The definition of a human hybrid is having both elements from humans and animals. I think another definition other than that and is popular in literature and media culture is having both elements from computers and humans.
<br><br>
Chapter 2
<br>
1. “Opaque technology” is a technology that is always tripping the user up, and is considered something like a computer keeps on crashing and you can’t get things done or just doesn’t know how to get the computer working. “Transparent technology” is the opposite. It is the technology that is well fitted to and is more convenient for the user to use.
<br><br>
2. An example of technology that might be better served if it were more transparent is cell phones. In the earlier age of cell phones, the only purpose is for it to call people. Now a day, cell phones are like mini computers. For older people, dealing with cell phones now a day could be very confusing because they don’t know how it works. But at the same time, cell phones now are more convenient for younger people and people who have adapted to the new technology. An example of technology that might be better served if it were more opaque is a watch, just like the apple watch. A traditional hand watch only shows the time and maybe the date but now they have an apple watch that can do more than just tell the time and date. They can receive calls or text messages and also have pictures in them. This is more convenient for people who own an iPhone, they could answer calls or see messages without bringing their phones out.
<br><br>
3. I think the watch and dictionary example discussed in the book is valid because it is something that is pretty straightforward and can be considered a transparent technology.
