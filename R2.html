<h1>Reading 2</h1>
<br><br><br>

  Chapter 3
<br>
Summary:
In this chapter, they are talking about the plastic brain which means our brain can “readily project feelings and sensation beyond the biological shell” (pg 62). There are some tricked or experiments listed in the reading. It is just some activities you can do to trick your brain with feelings and sensations. It also talked about how our brain prefers meta-knowledge which means our brains rather obtain and make full use of the information we get instead of baseline knowledge.
<br><br>
Question 1:
A time where my senses have momentarily misled me was when I am wearing contact lenses and I tried to push my non-existent glasses up. I got used to wearing glasses so I always have this hand gesture of pushing up my glasses on my nose, so when I am not wearing glasses, but my vision is clear because I am wearing contact lenses, I would have this feeling that my “glasses” are falling from my nose and I want to push them up but I am really pushing nothing.
<br><br>
Question 2:
I think the idea behind the “The Early Adapters Dream Technology”  and the “Mangrove Analogy” convey the role of language and its relationship to thought and meaning is
<br><br>
Question 3:
The idea of meta-learning and constructive learning is pretty similar, they both are more than just basic learning. Meta-learning is about gaining more information about the information, like learning how to get the information and where the information comes from then just knowing the information. Constructive learning is building more from the information you got to make it better. You learn from the information to build more knowledge.

Chapter 4
<br>
Summary:
In this chapter, they are talking about the sense of telepresence. Our brain can adapt to new things and learn them quickly. The reading also talked about how the beginning process of the brain which is a child’s brain. A newborn brain learns the fastest and they learn the coordinations and movements of their limbs very early in life.
<br><br>
Question 1:
The two main elements of action discussed in the book that is required for telepresence to exist are feedback and control.
<br><br>
Question 2:
A form of telepresence I have experienced was when I was watching a youtube video on my phone. The video was a VR-like video, when you turn your phone, the video also turns so you can look at the ceiling, the floor, turn left and turn right. The video follows your turn to show everything on the screen. It is kind of like a VR headset but without the headset.
<br><br>
Question 3:
other mechanics and sensory modalities that I think are based on telepresence ideas are ASMR videos. There are ASMR videos where they are “cleaning” the ear, they will have a mic in an ear model and they will be brushing the ear with a q-tip or a brush. So when the listener is wearing a headset or earphone, it really sounds like the brush is brushing the inside of your ears.
