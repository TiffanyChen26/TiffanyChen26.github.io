<p>This piece of art was made when the COVID-19 pandemic started. During this time the whole country was locked down, everybody was quarantined. This image shows a bird trapped in a cage, representing the people at the time were being trapped at home. The glitch of the image represents confusion and fear people were experiencing. I thought of using glitches to portray this kind of feeling because when people see a glitch, often this happens when something is wrong or is broken with their electronic devices. The user is confused on what's going to happen next and how they are going to fix this problem. Oftentimes, they would feel the anxiety of what if it can't be fixed.</p>

<img src="Pictures/Drawing.jpg" style="width:20%" class="portfolio">

<br><br>

<p>This is a watercolor painting of a self-portrait. The meaning behind this piece is to show that everybody puts up a facade of greatness but in reality, we all have our ugly thoughts. Racism,we all say we are not racist but truthfully, we all are. We just don't show it. No matter where we learn it from, either from our parents or from the environment we grew up in, we will be biased against certain races.</p>

<p>Trapped in Yourself was a piece I made that represent myself. I always hold my feelings in and not let anyone know how I truly feel. I always have a mask on which is like the ball in the picture. But once people get to know me, it's like looking at the inside of the ball above, and learning about the stories contained within.
<br>
For this piece, I downloaded a few objects and the girl figure from Google Poly and combined them together in MeshMixer. After I created this figure, I uploaded it onto Sketchfab and made it into a VR perspective. When looking through virtual reality glasses, you would see only the outside of the ball but once you move a step forward, you will see whatâ€™s inside the ball.

<p>For this piece, I downloaded a human male body from Google Poly and used MeshMixer to edit the animal body parts on it. After I finished with the figure, I uploaded it onto Mixamo to add the animation. I made it a hip hop dancer and then uploaded that onto Sketchfab. On sketchfab, I made it into a metallic material so it looks shiny.</p>
