<p> This song I used for this video is a remix called 'In The End' by Mellen Gi and Tommee Profitt. I downloaded the video of the spinning earth from Videvo.com and other GIF images from Imgur.com. I then combined all of them together in Premiere Pro and downloaded music from Youtube to add in to the video. </p>

<p> The meaning behind this video is that this world is slowly dying due to global warming and pollution. The lyrics of the song goes really well with the meaning I want to portray. Many are trying to help this world to make it better but in the end it doesn't matter because the world is still getting worse each day. </p>

<p> For this video, I used my mom as my actress and filmed her using a DSLR camera. I then used Premiere Pro to put the footage together and added background music.</p>

<p> When making this video, I wanted to show the daily life of people back in the days in China because I'm Chinese. Then the video transitions to present time and the whole story changes. For the old times, I made the video black and white and added some glitch effects on it to show that the camera quality was not that great back then. The actress was farming and feeding animals because that was what people in the past do throughout their days. In the modern times, The video quality is much clearer and it's in color.

<p> In this video, I downloaded a bunch of gif videos from Giphy.com and put them all together in Premiere Pro. The music I added in there is the theme some from Nyan Cat. </p>
<p> This video is to show a story of a typical teenager when they are doing their homework or whatever they are doing that is important. When teenagers are doing their homework, they tend to get distracted and end up doing other things other than their work. They will fool around until the end when they finally remember what they needed to do, they get frustrated because they forgot to do the important stuff. </p>
