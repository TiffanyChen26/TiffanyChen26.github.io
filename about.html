      Art is something I've been intrested in since I was a kid. I love doing different mediums of art like painting, crafting,
      pencil drawing, etc. I am currently learning how digital art and conceptual art at San Jose State University. I want to pursue in art as a career and since the world now is all about digital works, I thought digital media art design would be perfect for me.

      I am an Asian American Chinese girl. I was born in China and came to the United States when I was six-years-old. I was always into drawing since I was little. I was interested in art because of my grandpa. He was an architectural designer and also an industrial designer. I see many of his art growing up and I was inspired to be just like him. I want to have his skills to draw such amazing art pieces.

	   When I came to the United States, I was only with my mom. We were living in poverty with not much resources that we could rely on. I didnâ€™t have that much materials to master my skills to draw. All I have was regular 2.0 pencils and construction papers I got from school. With minimal materials, I started to self learn how to draw. I started off with drawing realistic objects around the room. Then I started to draw cartoon characters from picture books.
