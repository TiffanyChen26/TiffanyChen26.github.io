      I am a ChineseAmerican girl working towards a degree in Digital Media Arts. I've always been into art and plan to continue pursuing art in the future. I became more interested in digital design and video editing throughout my time in college. I even learned a lot about photoshopping, 3D modeling, and coding! Through these different courses, I also found my love for photography. But before all of that, I was immersed in drawing and painting. Working with different mediums is fun—from watercolor to oil paint and from charcoal to pen drawing—anything that could be used artistically, I could work with it!

      Although my specific future goal is still unclear, I know my heart longs for creativity.

    My need for creativity has led me to start a small business on my own to sell my paintings. I also paint and design shoes for people too! You can contact me through my social media or the contact information below this page to order!
